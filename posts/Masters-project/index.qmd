## Abstract

Creating a robust curriculum is key to ensuring success in an academic
degree. This paper provides insight into the use of data science tools
to enhance curriculum mapping in higher education. Using course learning
outcomes and program (degree) learning outcomes, a network map is
produced to ensure synthesized outcomes that can allow for great success
of a program and enforce student education. Based off this project,
different departments and universities can obtain insightful information
about their own curriculum and how successful their curriculum mapping
is. Students can also benefit from seeing the way course learning
outcomes map to their program learning outcomes which could guide them
through their studies and future careers.
